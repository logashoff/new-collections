# Save Tabs

Save Tabs is a browser extension that allows to quickly save and restore open tabs. It's similar to browser's default "Bookmark all tabs..." behavior, but it doesn't create bookmark entries and all data is stored offline within extension. It doesn't use any online services or connections. Import and export is done by saving and loading JSON file.
